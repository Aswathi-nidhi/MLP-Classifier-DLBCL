# MLP-Classifier-DLBCL - MLP-COO
Developed a python implemented deep learning based classifier for classifying cell of origin based gene expression data of DLBCL in to its subtypes ABC and GCB

MLP-COO is a DLBCL classification model with high accuracy (99.67%) that is built using multilayer perceptron ,i.e., subtype of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). This model classify DLBCL cases on the basis of gene expression into ABC (activating B-cell like) and GCB ( germinal center B-cell like).
